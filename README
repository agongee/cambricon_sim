VTune Amplifier user mode collection may fail to run on Ubuntu* (200197563)
VTune Amplifier may fail to collect data for Hotspots and Threading analysis types on the Ubuntu operating system. Once a collection is started, the message appears in the output: "Failed to start profiling because the scope of ptrace() system call application is limited. To enable profiling, please set /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope to 0. See the Release Notes for instructions on enabling it permanently."
To workaround this problem for the current session, set contents of the /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope sysctl file to 0.
To make this change permanent, set kernel.yama.ptrace_scope value to 0 at /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf file using root permissions and reboot the machine.
