CPU Baseline

[Prerequisite]
1) Intel MKL must be installed.
To install Intel MKL, you have to download Intel Parallel Studio.

You can download from https://software.intel.com/en-us/parallel-studio-xe/choose-download.
You don't have to install all the features in Intel Parallel Studio.
The only thing you need is Intel MKL for C/C++.
If you want to compile with Intel C/C++ Compiler, include this, too.

To clear up the confusion, I recommend you to install Intel MKL in root. (Use sudo install_GUI.sh)

2) MKL environment variable must be activated.
> source /opt/intel/mkl/bin/mklvars.sh intel64

(if, you didn't install in root option, source /home/${USER}/intel/mkl/bin/mklvars.sh intel64)

3) Makefile
